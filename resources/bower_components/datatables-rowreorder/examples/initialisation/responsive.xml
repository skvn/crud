<info><![CDATA[

This example shows RowReorder being used with the Responsive extension for DataTables and also that it provides support for touch inputs to perform a row reorder. Responsive is particularly useful with mobile devices, but can also be useful on desktops where complex data sets are shown in the DataTable.

Note that the row reordering in this example is triggered by dragging the cells in the second column.
